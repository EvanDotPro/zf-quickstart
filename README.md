ZEND FRAMEWORK QUICK START
==========================

This repository tracks the Zend Framework QuickStart, found here:

* http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.html

The purpose of this repository is several:

* Support ongoing changes and development of the quick start code base
* Provide a snapshot of how the quick start might evolve in ZF2
* Provide baselines for benchmarking different MVC prototypes for ZF2

Notes
-----

This branch (features/zf2-zf1-mvc) tracks the master branch of the Zend
Framework 2 repository; at the time of release, it used revision c2863d5; if you
are using something earlier or later, your results may vary. 

You should symlink the ZF2 library into "library/Zend/" in order to run the
quick start.
